	<h2 id="about">About Skyler</h2>
	<p>
		Hi, I’m Fan Yang, though most people know me as Skyler. I’m originally from Shenzhen, China, and I’m currently in my senior year at <a href="http://www.babson.edu" target="_blank">Babson College</a> . With a passion for entrepreneurship and information technology, I’m eager to start my own business after graduation and plan to further my education in grad school. My academic journey has been driven by the desire to innovate and create solutions that can make a real impact in the world.

	<h2 id="hobby">My Hobby</h2>
	<p>
		
		Outside of my academic pursuits, I have a strong passion for sports and outdoor activities. Skiing and basketball have always been my go-to hobbies, allowing me to stay active and challenge myself physically. Recently, I’ve also discovered a love for pickleball, which has been a great way to unwind and have fun. When I’m not on the move, I cherish the time spent with my cat and dog, who are always there to keep me company.
