	<h2>Project Objective:</h2>
	<p>The objective of this project is to demonstrate the design of a website that provides detailed data about boutique coffee shops in New York City, along with my personal ratings and reviews. The website will allow users to view these reviews and gain insight into the atmosphere, menu, and suitability of each coffee shop for different activities such as work, casual meetings, or quick stops. For this demonstration, I will focus on five coffee shops, with in-depth content for three of them, including their menu and recommended beverages.</p>
		
	<h2>Target Audience:</h2>
	<p>The target audience for my website is coffee enthusiasts, students, tourists, and professionals in New York City who are looking to explore local boutique coffee shops, understand their unique offerings, and discover spaces that fit their needs.</p>
		
	<h2>Page Content Plan:</h2>
	<p>
		<ol>
			<li>Home Page: A welcoming introduction to the website, featuring an overview of the project, the purpose of the website, and a logo.
			<li>About Us: Information about the project’s background and purpose.
			<li>Coffee Shop Map: An interactive map showing the location of all featured coffee shops. Clicking on any map marker will take the user to the relevant coffee shop’s dedicated page.
		    <ul>
			   Individual Coffee Shop Pages: Each coffee shop page will include:
		        <li>Name and address of the coffee shop</li>
				<li>Atmosphere description (e.g., suited for coffee chats, working/studying, or grab-and-go)
			    <li>Menu and featured beverages, along with my personal recommendations and comments on popular drinks or bakery items.
			</ul>
			<li>Contact Us: A page where users can submit feedback or inquiries.
			<li>Credits: A page acknowledging resources and contributions.
