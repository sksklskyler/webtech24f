	<h2>Designed by <br>
        enthusiasts, <br>
        for enthusiasts <h2>
		<p>At Kohi, we live and breathe coffee. Our founder has been on a journey from enjoying coffee at specialty cafés for nearly a decade, to crafting his own brews. Like many enthusiasts, she found it challenging to discover quality cafés—especially when exploring new cities. Tired of spending hours researching or ending up with a less-than-perfect cup, Kohi was born out of a desire to help coffee lovers find exceptional coffee experiences with ease.</p>

We believe in creating a space where coffee enthusiasts can connect with local cafés that share their passion, fostering a community that celebrates the artistry and culture of coffee. By supporting these cafés, Kohi strengthens a network where both patrons and cafés thrive together.</p>
